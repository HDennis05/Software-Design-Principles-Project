## Final Mark for Module: 70%

Using an agile approch to programming. I worked in a team of 5 to tackle the sustainable development goal, Zero Hunger.
We decided to tackle this with a community gardening centre app. Our aim was to allow our target audience; a local community to grow their own
sustainable food supply from locally sourced suppliers and sell this to other community members. 

Throughout the semester we held scrum meetings and larger team meetings. We worked to tight and frequent deadlines and had two main sprints. 

Our final application allowed for different user views:
-Admin: can manage all plots, users and crops in the system. They could create, delete and ban users.
-Users: can create a new plot and plant any crop in the system. They can then track the crops individual water level and growth level. They are able to track watering days and also rain for the whole garden.
-The marketplace: Allows any user to sell or buy crops from the garden.

My role in the group:
• Database Management: I created all 6 CSV files for the system. I also wrote the crode to access, and edit these files through the application, and got it integrated into the final system.
• Class creation and finalisation: I created the Plot class to allow the tracking of water and growth level. Due to the classes being coded by different individuals they did not work together. I took all the other classes and got them to a workable level where they all functioned cohesively with each other.
• Mentoring: I helped the other members of my group understand and use the CSV files.
• Application Functionality: I worked on methods for the final application such as: user watering crops, rain tracking, user request supplies, admin create new crop type.
• Documentation: Created UML, ER and MEnu diagrams for our final documentation. 

We used Gitlab for version control and code sharing. This was through the Queen's University Gitlab: 
As it was our first time using Git we had a few issues with the main branch and moved to "Fixed Branch" instead.
